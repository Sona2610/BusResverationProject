# BusResverationProject
The project allows passengers to book seats on available buses.
Passengers can enter their name, choose a bus number, and specify the booking date.
The system checks if a seat is available on the chosen bus for the selected date.
If a seat is available, the booking is confirmed and added to the bookings list.
If a seat is not available, the passenger is informed that the bus is full, and they can try another bus or date.
The program continues to run until the user chooses to exit.
